# mfe-dashboard
Dashboard part of my small __MFE__ project (__mfe__ stands for micro front-ends, get it? ðŸ˜‰). This is just a small project for the sole purpose of learning micro front-ends.

It's supposed to be integrated with the other three repositories, mfe-container (the main container part), mfe-auth (responsible for authentication) and mfe-marketing.
